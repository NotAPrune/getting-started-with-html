    <h1>The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
  <div>
    <b>- The Web<br></b>
    <p>
      The web is a collection of pages made with HTML. These pages are used to display content or to point to other pages with content using URLs. Content can be many things including plain text, video, music, documents and HTML.

    <b>- HTML<br></b>
    <p>
      HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language is the language used to construct web pages. It uses a defined set of tags that allows a page creator to manipulate and display content exactly how they want.
      <br><br>
      Tags come in two different types, inline and block. Inline elements manipulate the content within a line and untouched content flows seamlessly before and after it. Block elements, however, create a box around the content that takes up space with a definable width and height.
      <br><br>
      A tag, or set of tags with their associated content is known as an element. Elements can have attributes associated with them for various functionality including, but not limited to: CSS Styling, hyperlink URL, image sources and alternate text.
    </p>

    <b>- URLs<br></b>
    <p>
      URLs can be thought of as pointers that direct a user from one web page to another in order to view the content. This is essentially the residential address of the page on the World Wide Web and tells your browser exactly where to find it when you click on the URL.

    <b>-Using Code<br></b>
    <p>
      Code is very powerful, but also very specific. As a coder, it is important to understand what your code will do and how to use it. Computers are stupid and lack the ability to make assumptions about your code that a person might make. This is, however, a good thing because it means the computer can, and will, only do exactly as you tell it to. No more, no less.
